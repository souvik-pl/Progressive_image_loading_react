# Progressive Image Loading
This React application demonstrates progressive image loading, a technique that enhances the user experience by loading and displaying a low-resolution image initially, followed by the higher-resolution version. This approach provides users with a faster perceived loading time and allows them to interact with the content while the high-quality image is still loading.
